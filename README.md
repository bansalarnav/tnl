# tnl

Expose a local HTTP service through your own public `tnld` server. The public endpoint uses HTTPS.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo
- A public server with TCP port 443 open
- A local HTTP service to expose

## 1. Set up the public server

Clone this repository on the server, then run:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnld -- setup
cargo run --release -p tnld -- start --background
```

Setup detects the server's public IP and defaults to a free `nip.io` domain. If you use your own domain, add the DNS records printed by the command. Certificate issuance requires public TCP port 443 to reach the configured listen port.

Create credentials for a client:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnld -- invite-client my-laptop
```

Copy the `tnl-login-v1...` value it prints.

## 2. Log in from your local machine

Clone this repository locally and run:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnl -- login 'tnl-login-v1...'
```

## 3. Expose a local service

If your app is running on port 3000:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnl -- expose 3000
```

The client prints the public HTTPS URL once it is ready. To request a memorable subdomain, add a name:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnl -- expose 3000 --name my-app
```

Keep this command running while the tunnel is in use. To stop a background server later, run:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnld -- stop
```
